# Kilo JetBrains

AI coding agent plugin for JetBrains IDEs.

To try the v7 Early Access Program plugin, follow the [JetBrains EAP installation guide](https://kilo.ai/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/jetbrains#jetbrains-early-access).

---

## Set up your environment

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** -- used to run package build scripts
- **JDK 21+** -- required by Gradle and the IntelliJ Platform SDK. Check with `java -version`. The preferred way to install is via [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/install):

  ```bash
  # Install SDKMAN (if not already installed)
  curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash

  # Install and activate Java 21 (Eclipse Temurin)
  sdk install java 21-tem
  sdk use java 21-tem
  ```

- **IntelliJ IDEA** -- to run the plugin in a sandboxed IDE

---

## Fresh worktree setup

When working in a git worktree (e.g. via the Agent Manager), run `bun install` from the repo root before building or running Gradle tasks:

```bash
bun install
```

This installs Node dependencies required by the build scripts.

---

## Open in IntelliJ

When you open the monorepo root in IntelliJ IDEA, the Gradle project at `packages/kilo-jetbrains/` should be auto-detected via `.idea/gradle.xml`. If not, link it manually: **File > Settings > Build Tools > Gradle > +** and select `packages/kilo-jetbrains/settings.gradle.kts`.

---

## Build locally

From `packages/kilo-jetbrains/`:

```
bun run build
```

This builds the plugin without bundling CLI binaries. The backend downloads the pinned Kilo CLI release for the host platform at connect time. The plugin archive is output to `build/distributions/`.

Or via Turbo from the repo root:

```
bun turbo build --filter=@kilocode/kilo-jetbrains
```

---

## Build for production

From `packages/kilo-jetbrains/`:

```
bun run build:production
```

This builds the plugin without bundling CLI binaries. The backend downloads the pinned Kilo CLI release for the host platform at connect time.

The built plugin archive is at `build/distributions/kilo.jetbrains-<version>.zip`. This zip can be installed in any JetBrains IDE via **Settings > Plugins > Install Plugin from Disk**.

---

## Releasing

See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the full release process, including how to tag and push an RC, where to watch workflow progress, how to install RC builds, and how the signed bundled CLI build is published to the GitHub-hosted stable plugin repository.

---

## Run the plugin

Use the checked-in `Run IDE (Split Mode)` run configuration (or `./gradlew --no-configuration-cache runIdeSplitMode` from `packages/kilo-jetbrains/`) to launch the backend and frontend halves of a local split-mode sandbox. The backend downloads the pinned CLI release on first connect.

Use `runIde` only when you need a monolithic sandboxed IntelliJ instance.

Production packaging uses `bun run build:production` and still downloads the host CLI at runtime.

### Run the split backend

Use the checked-in `Run IDE (Backend)` run configuration (or `./gradlew --no-configuration-cache runIdeBackend`) to launch just the backend half of a split-mode session.

If `Run IDE (Backend)` exits shortly after startup, check for an orphaned Java process from a previous backend run and kill it before restarting the backend.

Use `Run IDE (Frontend)` (or `./gradlew --no-configuration-cache runIdeFrontend`) with a running backend when you need frontend JVM debugging; `Run IDE (Split Mode)` launches the frontend itself and does not attach frontend debugging.

### Development Gradle properties

All properties below are passed with `-P` on the Gradle command line or in the run configuration's script parameters field.

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `kilo.splitModeServerPort` | `0` | Backend split-mode server port. `0` or omitted lets the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin pick a free port when the task runs. |
| `kilo.dev.storage.isolated` | `false` | When `true`, CLI runs with `XDG_*_HOME` pointing to `.kilo-dev/` in the worktree root, fully isolating dev storage from your real Kilo installation. Enabled by default in the checked-in split-mode run configurations. |
| `kilo.dev.worktree.root` | monorepo root | Worktree root used to resolve `.kilo-dev/`. Auto-detected from the Gradle project directory; override only when the auto-detection is wrong. |

The checked-in IDE run configurations pass `--no-configuration-cache` because the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin run-IDE tasks are not configuration-cache compatible in this setup.
They also pass `--purge-old-log-directories` so stale sandbox logs do not hide the current backend and frontend `kilo.log*` files.

Example with a fixed split-mode port:

```text
-Pkilo.dev.log.level=debug -Pkilo.splitModeServerPort=12345
```

### Dev storage isolation

When `kilo.dev.storage.isolated=true`, the CLI subprocess receives standard `XDG_*_HOME` env vars pointing under `.kilo-dev/` in the worktree root:

```
.kilo-dev/
  data/    -> XDG_DATA_HOME   (CLI uses .../data/kilo for sessions, logs, ...)
  config/  -> XDG_CONFIG_HOME (CLI uses .../config/kilo for global config)
  state/   -> XDG_STATE_HOME  (CLI uses .../state/kilo for state)
  cache/   -> XDG_CACHE_HOME  (CLI uses .../cache/kilo for cache, bin)
```

This keeps all development data isolated from your real Kilo installation. The `.kilo-dev/` directory is gitignored and created automatically on first run.

The checked-in `Run IDE (Backend)`, `Run IDE (Frontend)`, and `Run IDE (Split Mode)` run configurations enable this by default. To disable it:

```text
-Pkilo.dev.storage.isolated=false
```

---

### Debug logging properties

The plugin supports a few JVM system properties for local debugging. These are most useful with sandbox runs because the logs are mirrored to `kilo.log*` files for frontend and backend.

`kilo.dev.log.level`

- Controls the Kilo debug file logger level.
- Supported values: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `OFF`
- Default: `INFO`
- Use `DEBUG` to enable detailed chat tracing and lazy `log.debug { ... }` summaries.

`kilo.dev.log.chat.content`

- Controls how much chat text content appears in structured chat logs.
- Supported values:
  - `off`: no text previews, metadata only
  - `preview`: sanitized truncated previews
  - `full`: sanitized full content
- Default: `off`

`kilo.dev.log.chat.preview.max`

- Maximum preview size when `kilo.dev.log.chat.content=preview`
- Default: `160`

Where to find the log files:

- In sandbox runs, Kilo writes separate dev log files for each side under the IDE sandbox log directory reported by `PathManager.getLogDir()`.
- Frontend log file: `<sandbox log dir>/kilo-frontend/kilo.log`
- Backend log file: `<sandbox log dir>/kilo-backend/kilo.log`
- Rotated files use numbered suffixes: `kilo.log.0`, `kilo.log.1`.
- Each sandbox process starts a new `kilo.log`, so the file holds exactly one run and the previous run stays readable as `kilo.log.0`. Installed builds keep appending instead.
- In practice these sit under the current `log_run*` sandbox logs for the active run.
- If you are unsure of the exact sandbox root, open the IDE log directory from the running sandbox instance and then look for the `kilo-frontend/` and `kilo-backend/` subdirectories.

### Reading the logs in the Run tool window

The checked-in IDE run configurations attach both files as `<log_file>` tabs ("Backend Kilo", "Frontend Kilo"). Two IntelliJ defaults are worth knowing:

- `skipped` defaults to `true`, which makes the tab open the file at its current end offset and show nothing that was already written. The checked-in configurations set `skipped="false"`. The `show_all` attribute is unrelated — it only selects "every glob match" over "the newest match" for pattern paths.
- The tab's log level filter defaults to **Show errors and warnings**, and Kilo's dev logs are almost entirely `INFO`/`DEBUG`, so a correctly wired tab still looks empty. Open the tab's filter control (funnel icon) and pick **Show all**. This is a per-project setting stored in `.idea/workspace.xml` under `LogFilters`, so it cannot ship with the run configuration.

Runs started from the Agent Manager against a git worktree get their log paths rebased onto that worktree, because `$PROJECT_DIR$` was already expanded against the main checkout when the configuration was read (`WorktreeRunAdapter.rebaseLogs`).

### Which run configurations a worktree can run

The Agent Manager Run popup only lists configurations whose location it can repoint at the worktree, so it never silently runs the main checkout instead. `WorktreeRunAdapter.supports` accepts three kinds:

| Kind | Location that gets rebased |
|---|---|
| External-system (Gradle, Maven) | `ExternalSystemRunConfiguration.settings.externalProjectPath` |
| `CommonProgramRunConfigurationParameters` (CLI-style) | `workingDirectory`, plus `WORKTREE_PATH`/`REPO_PATH` env vars |
| Types listed in `WorktreeRunAdapter.PATHS` | a path in the configuration's serialized state |

The third kind exists for types that keep their working directory out of any callable API. npm/yarn/pnpm/bun script configurations (`js.build_tools.npm`) are the current entry: their `<package-json>` path *is* the working directory — `NpmRunProfileState` takes its parent and hands it to `GeneralCommandLine.withWorkingDirectory` — and the typed setter lives in the Ultimate-only JavaScript plugin, so the rebase goes through `writeExternal` → rewrite → `readExternal` instead. That matches the VS Code Agent Manager contract of cwd = worktree.

Adding a type means one `PATHS` entry, not a generic rewrite: blanket-rebasing every repo-absolute path in an arbitrary configuration's serialized state would reach into types from any installed plugin, where a path may need to keep pointing at the main checkout.

Module-classpath configurations (Application, Spring Boot, tests) are not transplanted — their classpath comes from the main checkout's module — and go through the platform's own build-system delegation instead (`WorktreeRunDelegate`). Anything neither path can run is listed in a collapsed **Not Supported** submenu with the reason, and logged by `WorktreeRunManager.configs`:

```bash
grep "worktree run: configs listed" packages/kilo-jetbrains/.intellijPlatform/sandbox/kilo.jetbrains/kilo-backend/kilo.log
```

Worktree npm runs need the worktree's own `node_modules`; that is what the Agent Manager setup script is for.

Recommended combinations:

```text
-Dkilo.dev.log.level=DEBUG -Dkilo.dev.log.chat.content=off
```

```text
-Dkilo.dev.log.level=DEBUG -Dkilo.dev.log.chat.content=preview -Dkilo.dev.log.chat.preview.max=120
```

Use `off` first. Switch to `preview` only when you need prompt or tool payload hints to diagnose a problem. Use `full` only for short local reproductions because logs can grow quickly.

## Run Gradle directly

For direct local packaging, run:

```bash
bun run build
```

This runs `./gradlew buildPlugin`.

For production verification:

```
./gradlew buildPlugin -Pproduction=true
```
