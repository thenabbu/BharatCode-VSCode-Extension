/**
 * A scoped size memo for [Stack] and [Align].
 *
 * Swing caches a container's sizes only while the container is valid. Both layouts ask each child for its
 * minimum, preferred and maximum size, so on an invalid tree every nesting level triples the work below it. A
 * list renderer is exactly that tree: one stamp, invalidated wholesale before every row it paints, measured and
 * laid out again for each paint and hit test.
 *
 * Inside [measure], each Stack and Align answers each kind of size once per container and container size. An
 * answer is dropped when the container is resized (both layouts probe children with the space they are given,
 * so a size can depend on it) or when Swing invalidates the container through `invalidateLayout`, and outside
 * [measure] nothing is cached at all.
 *
 * Wrap only a single top-down layout or measuring pass that does not change the content being measured: a
 * content change below a container that is already invalid does not reach it, so its answer would go stale.
