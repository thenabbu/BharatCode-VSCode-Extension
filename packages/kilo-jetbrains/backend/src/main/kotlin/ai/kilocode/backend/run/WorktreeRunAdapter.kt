/**
 * Decides which run configurations can be transplanted into a git worktree and builds the
 * transient per-worktree clone that the platform execution pipeline runs.
 *
 * Supported:
 * - External-system (Gradle) configurations: the clone's external project path is mapped onto
 *   the worktree, so the worktree's own wrapper builds and runs the worktree's code (the Gradle
 *   plugin explicitly handles unlinked project paths by falling back to the path's wrapper).
 * - Command-line style configurations implementing [CommonProgramRunConfigurationParameters]:
 *   the clone's working directory is mapped onto the worktree and WORKTREE_PATH/REPO_PATH env
 *   vars are injected (same contract as the VS Code Agent Manager run scripts).
 * - Types listed in [PATHS], whose location is reachable only through serialized state; see
 *   [relocate].
 *
 * All kinds additionally get their `<log_file>` tabs mapped onto the worktree; see [rebaseLogs].
 *
 * Paths are rebased rather than replaced, because both fields commonly point at a subproject
 * (`<repo>/packages/kilo-jetbrains`) rather than the repository root; see [rebase].
 *
 * Module-classpath configurations (plain JVM Application, JUnit, ...) are excluded: even with
 * a worktree working directory they would execute the main checkout's compiled classes.
 *
 * The adapter also synthesizes the worktree build ([buildSettings]). A real IDE Build Project is
 * impossible here: `ProjectTaskManager` describes work as [com.intellij.openapi.module.Module]
 * instances, which only exist for an open project, so a worktree directory can never be its target.
 * Running the external system's own build tasks against the worktree copy of a linked root is the
 * reachable equivalent, and relies on the same unlinked-path support as the transplanted configs.
