# Memory

Kilo Memory lets Kilo remember useful details about a project across sessions, so you do not have to repeat decisions, constraints, environment setup, or corrections. It is opt-in and scoped to one project.

{% callout type="info" title="Opt-in and project-only" %}
Memory is disabled by default. Enable it per project. Kilo stores project memory only; personal or user-level memory is not supported.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="note" title="Not the deprecated Memory Bank" %}
Kilo Memory is separate from the deprecated **memory bank**. The memory bank used rule files under `.kilo/rules/memory-bank/` and is replaced by [AGENTS.md](/docs/customize/agents-md). 
{% /callout %}

## What memory stores

Kilo keeps memory in three Markdown source files plus saved session digests:

| Source | Contains |
|---|---|
| `project.md` | Project facts, decisions, constraints, and open questions |
| `environment.md` | Commands, paths, and tooling details |
| `corrections.md` | Corrections to earlier memory |
| Session digests | Short summaries of prior sessions |

Each entry is a saved key-value note. Memory is saved per repository, so linked git worktrees share the same project memory.

These files live in a per-project folder under Kilo's global data directory: `<data>/memory/<project-slug>-<sha1-12>/`. On typical systems `<data>` is `~/.local/share/kilo` (respecting `XDG_DATA_HOME` if set), so the folder is `~/.local/share/kilo/memory/<project-slug>-<sha1-12>/`. 

Alongside the three source files, the folder holds a `sessions/` directory with saved session digest Markdown files, plus internal index and state files that Kilo manages automatically and that you should not edit by hand.

## Enable memory

{% tabs %}
{% tab label="VSCode" %}

Enable project memory in **Settings → Context** with the **Project memory** switch. The same section shows the storage location, an **Inspect** button, and an **Auto-save project memory** switch.

You can also run `/memory on` in chat, or use the Command Palette command **Kilo Code: Toggle Project Memory**.

{% /tab %}
{% tab label="CLI" %}

Run `/memory on` in the TUI. The Memory row in the sidebar shows the current state.

```text
/memory on
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Automatic memory (auto-save)

When memory is enabled and auto-save is on, Kilo reviews completed turns and saves project facts and session digests automatically. Auto-save is on by default.

- Auto-save sends best-effort-redacted turn context to your configured model provider. Disable it with `/memory auto off` or the **Auto-save project memory** switch.
- Automatic saves only add or update memory. They never delete it.
- Secret-like content is filtered before it is written. Session digests are redacted, and project memory entries that match common secret patterns are discarded.
- Kilo throttles auto-save, so not every turn triggers a save.

Explicit saves are not throttled.

### Use a different model for auto-save

Auto-save can use a different model than your main session. By default it runs on the model your session is using. To customize it, set `memory_model` in `kilo.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "memory_model": "kilo/kilo-auto/small"
}
```

A smaller or faster model is usually enough for this background work, so you can keep a more capable model for the session itself. If `memory_model` is unset, malformed, or unavailable, auto-save uses the session model. The setting does not affect explicit saves or recall, which run in your session.

## Explicit memory

Use explicit commands when you want to control what is stored:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/memory remember <text>` | Save a project memory note |
| `/memory correct <text>` | Save a correction to project memory |
| `/memory forget <query>` | Remove matching project memory |

Kilo can also manage memory itself through two tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kilo_memory_save` | Save, correct, or forget memory when you ask Kilo to remember or update something |
| `kilo_memory_recall` | Search saved memory for details that are not in the injected index |

Both tools ask for approval by default. Recall can be allowed always; saving asks each time.

## How memory is used

At the start of a session, Kilo injects a compact memory index that summarizes what is stored. The index is a summary, not the full memory store, so Kilo can call `kilo_memory_recall` to fetch exact details on demand.

Recall supports four modes:

| Mode | Use |
|---|---|
| `search` | Search saved project memory and session digests |
| `typed` | Search saved project memory only |
| `digest` | Read saved session digests |
| `catalog` | List stored memory entries and session digests |

Memory is context, not instruction. Current messages, repository files, and [AGENTS.md](/docs/customize/agents-md) take precedence over saved memory.

## Command reference

The `/memory` command is also available as `/mem`.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/memory on` | Enable project memory |
| `/memory off` | Disable project memory |
| `/memory status` | Show the storage location and a stored memory overview |
| `/memory show` | Show stored project memory |
| `/memory remember <text>` | Save a project memory note |
| `/memory correct <text>` | Save a correction to project memory |
| `/memory forget <query>` | Remove matching project memory |
| `/memory auto on\|off` | Turn automatic memory saves on or off |
| `/memory inspect` | Reveal the project memory folder |
| `/memory rebuild` | Rebuild the memory index from source files |
| `/memory purge confirm` | Delete all project memory files |

## Storage and maintenance

Kilo stores project memory outside your repository, under Kilo's global data directory in a per-project folder (see [What memory stores](#what-memory-stores)). Run `/memory inspect` to reveal the exact folder for the current project.

- **Rebuild** regenerates the memory index from the source files. Use it if the index looks stale or incomplete.
- **Purge** permanently deletes all project memory files. It requires the explicit `confirm` argument: `/memory purge confirm`.

## Privacy

- Memory is stored locally and scoped to one project. Personal or user-level memory is not supported.
- Secret-like content is filtered before it is written. Session digests are redacted, and project memory entries that match common secret patterns are discarded.
- Auto-save sends best-effort-redacted turn context to your configured model provider. Turn it off with `/memory auto off` if you do not want automatic captures.
- Disabling memory stops injection, recall, and automatic capture. It does not delete stored memory.
