# Notebooks

Open interactive Python notebooks in a tab next to your chat, so you can explore and visualize data without leaving the conversation. A notebook is a shared document you and the agent build together: you edit and run cells directly, while the agent reads, writes, and runs cells alongside you as you talk through the analysis. Notebooks run on a dedicated notebook runtime.

## Open a notebook

A notebook opens as its own tab beside the chat. There are a few ways to get there:

- **Ask the agent** to list the files in your workspace, then select an `.ipynb` file in its reply to open it.
- **From the [Files](/docs/desktop/features/files) tab**, search or browse the workspace and select an `.ipynb` file.
- **Ask the agent to open it** by name — the agent can open and list notebooks for you, so the one you're discussing stays in view. You can also create a new notebook by asking the agent.

## Work with cells

The toolbar at the top of the notebook has controls to {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/code.svg" /%} add a code cell, {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/text-initial.svg" /%} add a Markdown cell, {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/chevrons-right.svg" /%} run cells, {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/rotate-ccw.svg" /%} restart, restart and run all cells, and {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/square.svg" /%} interrupt a running cell. Run a cell to see its output inline, and view the status (such as **Idle**) on the right of the toolbar.

Each individual cell includes controls to {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/play.svg" /%} run it, switch it between {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/code.svg" /%} code and {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/text-initial.svg" /%} Markdown, {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/eye-off.svg" /%} hide its input or output, and {% svgIcon src="/docs/img/desktop/trash.svg" /%} delete it.

## Edit with the agent

Work on notebooks together with the agent. Ask it to make a change — fix a typo, add analysis, rework a chart — and it reads the notebook, edits or adds cells, and saves. When the notebook is open beside the chat, the results appear in its tab, and a dot marks each cell the agent changes so you can see at a glance what it edited. The notebook doesn't need to be open, though — the agent can edit any notebook in your workspace.

## Environment and packages

Each notebook uses a Python environment. Select the kernel button in the toolbar to see the details of that environment. New notebooks can get a shared `environment.yml` in their workspace; toggle this under [Settings → Notebooks](/docs/desktop/settings/general#notebooks).

The agent can work with [conda environments](/docs/desktop/features/environments) too — ask it to find an appropriate conda environment for this notebook and point the notebook at it, and it will. A helpful pattern is to have the agent write an `environment.yml` into the workspace: then every notebook there, existing or new, picks up that environment automatically.

## Runtime status

The notebook runtime starts on demand. While it's starting you'll see a brief status; if it can't be reached, the tab shows a Retry button.
