// kilocode_change - new file

/**
 * Guards against accidentally inheriting workflows from upstream opencode.
 *
 * We regularly merge upstream. When upstream adds a new workflow under
 * `.github/workflows/`, it silently starts running in our CI unless we
 * explicitly review and accept it. This check makes that decision explicit:
 * the list of allowed workflows is hardcoded below, and any drift (added or
 * removed file in `.github/workflows/`) fails CI until the list is updated
 * deliberately.
 *
 * Only runnable workflows are checked (`.yml` / `.yaml`). Files under
 * `.github/workflows/disabled/` are Kilo-specific and can't run, so they're
 * not tracked here.
 *
 * To accept a new workflow: add its filename to `active`.
 * To drop one: remove its filename from the list.
